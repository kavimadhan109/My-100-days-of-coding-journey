## Statement
```
Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight - how many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?
The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339).
For example, if N = 3900, then 3900 seconds have passed since midnight. 
Therefore, the time now is 1:05am. 
So the program should print 1 65 - 1 full hour is passed since midnight, 65 full minutes passed since midnight.  
```

## Sample input
```
3900
```

## Sample output
```
1 65
```

## Code
```
N = int(input())
Full_Hours_Passed = int(N/3600)
Full_Minutes_Passes = int(N/60)
print(Full_Hours_Passed,Full_Minutes_Passes)
```
