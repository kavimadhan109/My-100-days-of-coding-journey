## Statemnt
```
Write a program that receives a number on the input.
It also should receive another value 'rev'  (either 0 or 1) on the input. 
 - If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs". 
 - If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".
 - If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".
 - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".
        - also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"
 - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".
        - also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
 - If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugPugs".
        - also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"
Otherwise, it prints the number.
REVERSE REQUIREMENT:
If the boolean 'rev' is True (or 1), then reverse the order of printing. 
   - "PugsJugsMugs" for multiples of 3, 5 and 7
   - "PugsMugs" for multiple of 5 and 7
   - "MugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 5 
   - "PugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 7
   ```
## Sample Input 1
```
73 
True  # contains 7 and 3, print reverse order
```
## Sample Output 1
```
PugsJugs
```
## Sample Input 2
```
51  # multiple of 3 and contains 5
```
## Sample Output 2
```
JugsMugs
```
## Code
```
i = int(input())
rev =int(input())
if rev:
  string = 'Jugs' * bool(i%3==0 or '3' in str(i))
  string = 'Mugs' * bool(i%5==0 or '5' in str(i)) + string
  string = 'Pugs' * bool(i%7==0 or '7' in str(i)) + string
  print( string or i)
else:
   print("Jugs" * (i%3==0 or '3' in str(i)) + "Mugs" * (i%5==0 or '5' in str(i)) + "Pugs" * (i%7==0 or '7' in str(i)) or i)
```
